Digital Twin for Human Fall Detection System
This project creates a digital twin of a human fall detection system. It mirrors the orientation and motion of a physical object, measured by an MPU6050 sensor connected to an Arduino or ESP32, into a Unity environment. The system is designed to track and replicate physical movements in real-time, providing a virtual visualization of orientation.
